        "\n",
        "In this section, we will provide you with exercises to practice calculating precision, recall, and the confusion matrix in the context of logistic regression. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the performance of your classification model beyond simple accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exercise 1: Calculating Precision and Recall\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a logistic regression model that predicts whether an email is spam or not, you have the following classification results on the test set:\n",
        "\n",
        "- True Positives (TP): 90\n",
        "- False Positives (FP): 10\n",
        "- True Negatives (TN): 50\n",
        "- False Negatives (FN): 30\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculate the precision and recall of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Precision\n",
        "Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It is a measure of a classifier's exactness. High precision relates to a low false positive rate. Calculate the precision using the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} $$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recall\n",
        "Recall (Sensitivity) is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class. It is a measure of a classifier's completeness. High recall relates to a low false negative rate. Calculate the recall using the formula:\n",

        "## Exercise 2: Confusion Matrix\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the same data from Exercise 1, create a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows the visualization of the performance of an algorithm.\n",

        "Create a Python function that takes in the values of TP, FP, TN, and FN and outputs a confusion matrix in a readable format.\n",

        "- False Negatives (FN): 60\n",
        "\n",
