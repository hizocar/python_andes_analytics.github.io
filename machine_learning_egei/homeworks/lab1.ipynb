        "## 1. Introduction to Dataframes in Pandas\n",
        "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can be of different types. It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table, or the `data.frame` in R. The DataFrame is one of the most commonly used pandas objects and is designed to handle a mix of numeric and non-numeric data.\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "Let's create a simple dataframe with product sales data.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "data = {\n",
        "    'Product Name': ['Laptop', 'Mouse', 'Keyboard'],\n",
        "    'Units Sold': [50, 150, 80],\n",
        "    'Price per Unit': [800, 20, 30]\n",
        "}\n",
        "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
